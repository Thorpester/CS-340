How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

When making a program I would try to keep it simple in case I may use it again later on when I have more experience with the language and change it to the needs that I have. For CRUD this holds true as you are able to change and have it adapt to your needs in the future if that's the case.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

Trying to approach a problem from outside the box and with different thoughts is what helps me solve my problems. When I am stumped and have no other options I seek outside help or suggestions that I have missed or never thought of.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

A Computer scientist is an engineer/developer for computer-based solutions. If I was to work with a company I would need how the business processes anything and how they would be able t distribute the needed upgrades to their people, I would also try to find a better way for them to simplify everything.
